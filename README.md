# Simple Microservice Architecture using Majordomo Protocol

This is a PoC(Prove of Concept) project to show that microservices can be 
achieved using ZeroMQ's Majordomo Pattern.

## Background Knowledge about the Majordomo Pattern of ZeroMQ

Before starting to introduce Majordomo Pattern, let's see what ZeroMQ does.

ZeroMQ is a messaging library, which allows you to design a complex communication system 
without much effort.

It has the following features:

  - Connect your code in any language, on any platform
  - Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast
  - Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer
  - High-speed asynchronous I/O engines, in a tiny library
  - Backed by a large and active open source community
  - Supports every modern language and platform
  - Build any architecture: centralized, distributed, small, or large

Some well-known companies are using ZeroMQ, for example, AT&T, Cisco, EA, NASA, 
Samsung Electronics, Microsoft, and CERN
